# loadforecast

Welcome to the **Load Forecasting Toolkit**! This repository implements a variety of state-of-the-art statistical models, deep learning approaches, and large language models for time series forecasting, with a primary focus on **load forecasting**.  

Researchers and practitioners can use this repository as a **baseline** for their work or adapt the provided implementations to other time series forecasting tasks with minimal modifications.  


**Statistical Models**：SeasonalNaive, RecursiveTabular, DirectTabular, CrostonSBA, NPTS, DynamicOptimizedTheta, AutoETS, AutoARIMA,
**Deep Learning Models**：TemporalFusionTransformer, DeepAR, PatchTST
**Large Language Model**：Chronos

While this repository is designed primarily for **load forecasting**, it can also be used for a wide range of time series forecasting problems, such as:  Energy demand prediction, Weather forecasting, Sales prediction, Anomaly detection
